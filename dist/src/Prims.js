    Step 1: Determine an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex of the MST.
    Step 2: Follow steps 3 to 5 till there are vertices that are not included 
            in the MST (known as fringe vertex).
    Step 3: Find edges connecting any tree vertex with the fringe vertices.
    Step 4: Find the minimum among these edges.
    Step 5: Add the chosen edge to the MST if it does not form any cycle.
    Step 6: Return the MST and exit
