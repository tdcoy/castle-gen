1. Generate rooms from available room list.
    - Main floor rooms and towers
    - Second floor rooms based on placement of 2 story main floor rooms and towers
    - Basement floor rooms
2. Find Delaunay Tetrahedralization used to connect rooms (Bowyer-Watson Algorithm, cirum circles to spheres)
3. Find Mininum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm) to guarentee every room is reachable
4. Randomly choose remaining edge's not connected to create additional hallways
5. For every hallway, use A* algorithm to find path between the rooms
    - Stairs/Spiral stair cases

1. Generate rooms from available room list.
    - Main floor rooms and towers
    - Second floor rooms based on placement of 2 story main floor rooms and towers
    - Basement floor rooms
2. Connect rooms
    - Main rooms to towers
    - Towers to walls and other towers
    - Minor rooms to cooresponding main rooms
3. Repeat for second floor and basement floor
